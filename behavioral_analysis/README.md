# Behavioral Analysis #

This presentation is about the use of behavioral analysis to determine how a piece of malware acts. These tools can be used primarily in REM Workstation and [REMnux] Virtual Machines but can also have applicability in some of the challenges we do. Make sure you isolate these VM's before attempting any malware analysis.
